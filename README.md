# mernstack-full-booking-app
This is a Fullstack booking app using the mernstack

This app allows a user to book rooms in various hotels as seen in my code in the client file
In the admin file in this code base it also
As said this is a Fullstack app using the mernstack which I used to create this 3 awesome app:
(1) The full functioning User app which on my code is the Client file. This allows Users to be able to book and make reservation on available rooms in different Hotels.
(2) The full functioning admin app which on my code is the Admin file. This allows the admin to be able to create and update Hotels and Rooms to users, Its also allows 
the admin to see requests made be users from the User/client app 
(3) The api file serves as the backend. This is store data and serves as the backend for both the users/client and the admin.

Please be patient with me as i would upload screenshots to all my code on my repo.
Thank you!
